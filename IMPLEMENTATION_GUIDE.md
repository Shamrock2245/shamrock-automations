## 🚀 How to Use the New Features

### Feature 1: Open Bond Form from Selected Row

**Steps:**
1. Go to the **Lee_County_Arrests** sheet
2. **Click on any row** with arrest data (row 2 or below)
3. Click menu: **🍀 Shamrock Automation → 🚔 Arrest Scraper → 📋 Open Bond Form (Selected Row)**
4. The form will open **pre-filled** with:
   - Defendant name, DOB, address, physical description
   - All charges (automatically split)
   - Bond amounts (split evenly across charges)
   - Case numbers
   - Court date, time, and location

### Feature 2: Lead Scoring

**Steps:**
1. Click menu: **🍀 Shamrock Automation → 🚔 Arrest Scraper → 📊 Score All Leads**
2. Wait for scoring to complete (shows progress dialog)
3. Two new columns will be added to your sheet:
   - **Lead_Score** (0-100 points)
   - **Lead_Status** (Hot/Warm/Cold/Disqualified)

**Scoring Criteria:**
- ✅ Bond $500-$50K: +30 points
- ✅ Cash/Surety bond: +25 points  
- ✅ In Custody: +20 points
- ✅ Complete data: +15 points

**Lead Categories:**

- 🚫 **Disqualified** (<0 points) - Not viable

**Pro Tip:** Sort by Lead_Score (descending) to see best leads first!

### Feature 3: Automatic Backfill

**Already working from v8.1!**

Click menu: **🍀 Shamrock Automation → 🚔 Arrest Scraper → 🔄 Backfill Existing Records**

This will:
- Find all rows with missing charges, case numbers, or court info
- Fetch the data from the charges API
